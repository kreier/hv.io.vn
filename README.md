Managing local homelab projects in Vietnam.

## Projects

I live in [Chung cư Hưng Vượng 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5ZPag2DvCcUSzM2d9) in Saigon, so the domain name hv.io.vn for my little projects made sense. Many services are only available inside the network, but some are also mapped to the internet. They are:

- [llm.hv.io.vn](https://llm.hv.io.vn) Try out the Open WebUI on my machine.
- [wp.hv.io.vn](https://wp.hv.io.vn) A wordpress blog hosted on my server.

## Local domains

To ensure secure communication even inside the network it is best to encrypt it. But for pi4.home I can't get a certificate from LetsEncrypt, so I need to import the certificate myself.
