The first days some 25% of all DNS traffic is related to ads and has to be blocked! What a blessing. Configuration and statistics at pi4.hv.io.vn/admin. Please don't ask me about this configuration - it took 12 hours with AI coding assistant to get this working!</p> <p>A side effect is that it is also a DNS server. So I can use it for different services inside the network to be mapped to easy-to-remember domain names. Like llm.server.home without having to change the <code>hosts</code> table on each client computer in my network. Very handy!</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>Just a small project site for some internet, docker, services, automation and network related ideas.</p> <p>It handles a lot of io, and is located in Vietnam.
